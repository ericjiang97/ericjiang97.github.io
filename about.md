## Hi there!

### I'm Eric and I'm currently a third year Bachelor of Information Technology Student at Monash University

#### Founder of [monPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu)  <br/> Co-Founder of [MARIE.js](https://marie-js.github.io/MARIE.js/) , [geckoDM](https://geckodm.github.io), FutureYou@Monash 

You can download my resume [here](/assets/downloads/EricJiang-Resume18.pdf)


I love building things üèóÔ∏è, whether it's Software, Mobile Apps or web apps - I would always try out new and awesome tech. I've built things in Java (Spring Boot), ReactJS (with Redux), React Native and much more...

Another reason why I love coding and building apps, is that I want to change the world. Such as making education more accessible and more enjoyable for everyone.

I am currently looking to Major in Computer Networks and Security as well as Minor in computer science.

I have not only particpated in Hackathons but also mentored during some hacks such as UniHack Mini 2017 and Hackamon 2018. I also do various tech talks, you can read more about my talks [here](/talks).
This is why, I have worked on many projects which have been used to improve student-community life in general. Such as CHS Newsletter Site, [MARIE.js](https://marie-js.github.io/MARIE.js/) , [geckoDM](https://geckodm.github.io) and [monPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu) 

## My Journey
### 2008: The Beginning
I started off my programming journey back when I was 11 with [Visual Basic .Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/) it was a neat little project. I also had done some bash scripting with cmd (remember back in those days) too.


### 2010: Web Development and C#
I had my first experience with Web Development and the beautiful Unity back in 2010.

### 2013: Joined GitHub!
