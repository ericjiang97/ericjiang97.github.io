## Hi there!

### I'm Eric and I'm currently a third year Bachelor of Information Technology Student at Monash University

#### Founder of [monPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu)  <br/> Co-Founder of [MARIE.js](https://marie-js.github.io/MARIE.js/) , [geckoDM](https://geckodm.github.io), FutureYou@Monash 


You can download my resume [here](/assets/downloads/EricJiang-Resume18.pdf")

I really love development in general as well and am very passionate about DevOps, and the security, service delivery and maintainability of any project. 

I am currently looking to Major in Computer Networks and Security as well as Minor in computer science.

One of the few reasons I love coding is that I want to change the world. Especially making education among everyone easier to access, but also make it more enjoyable and fun. 

I have not only particpated in Hackathons but also helped mentor during UniHack Mini 2017 and Hackamon 2018. 
This is why, I have worked on many projects which have been used to improve student-community life in general. Such as CHS Newsletter Site, [MARIE.js](https://marie-js.github.io/MARIE.js/) , [geckoDM](https://geckodm.github.io) and [monPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu)
